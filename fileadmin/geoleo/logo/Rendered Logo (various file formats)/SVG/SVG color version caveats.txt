# SVG color version caveats

As per Illustrator's rendering of SVG, the gradients in the color version of provided SVGs is slightly different than in the other rendered formats. I.e. this doesn't apply to the black & white version, *only* the color SVG version.

Although I still consider this provided color SVG to stay true to the intended design, this may or may not be an issue. Consider using any of the other vector formats provided.

At the time of this writing, I'm not exactly sure what's causing this, but I suspect it might be due to opacity masks used in the Illustrator CS5 project, which doesn't "sing" very well in SVG.

The best I could do to stay true to the intended design (see PNG formats), was to remove one or two such opacity layers prior to exporting the color SVG.
