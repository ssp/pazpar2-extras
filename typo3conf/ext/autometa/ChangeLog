features:
	* Find another solution to manipuate HTML output for not overriding the cache, maybe optional db saving.
	* Add/generate other meta elements out of content.
	  - "author" could be generated/read out of page content via regular expression (if available) or set static?
	* Add support for dublin core (not really needed though).
	* Remove meta generator.
	* Won't add support for http-equiv since they are no "real" meta informations and should stick to http header.

todo:
	* Add errorhandling on unknown charset.
	* Errorhandling on empty charset, fallback to UTF-8?
	* Use PCRE to find author (defined in TypoScript).
	* Proper code documentation for functions (comments - partly done).
	* Possibly keep long numeric values.
	* Make weighted keywords configureable (weight amount of specific elements).
	* Make the use of TYPO3SEARCH comments optional though it's not useful anyway.
	* Test if unicode properties (\p{L} work with any non UTF-8 charset or without u modifier.
	* Case-sensitive stopwords.
	* Add TypoScript setup of "page.meta" and constants "plugin.autometa" to debug output.
