  
  == Motivation == 
  
  The class tslib_pibase if the hitherto base class for extension development. 
  
  There are some issus with caching, cryptic names and a jungle of link
function. 
  The concept of a single class is well suited for the development of little
  extensions. As a framework for bigger projects that require a separation of
the
  buisiness logic and presentation it has limitations. 
  
  lib/div is a common effort of extension developers, to give an answer to this
  limitations. 
  
  Although the development of TYPO3 is called an open project in theory, the 
  practice often differs from this. Tries to get necessery improvements the core
  depends on the good will of little number of core developers. Even if patches
  are provided, it usually takes far to much time until they get applied. 
  
  Lib/div is designed to be more open. Patches to lib/div can directly be
applied 
  to the subversion, but they are reviewed by the lead developer(s) before they
  are published to TER. However everybody is free to use unreviewed sources from
  the SVN repository.
  
  == Targets reached ==
  
  * The library works independent from tslib_pibase.
  * The library works in PHP4 and PHP5
  * Conceptions of PHP5 are ported back to PHP4 (autoloader, SPL)
  * tx_div is a collection of static functions for extensions, similar to
    t3lib_div.
  * The lib extension contains a framework for extension development, that is
    extensible by the use of powerfull external libraries for database access, 
    rendering and form handling.
  * The overall architecture follows the Model-View-Controller pattern.
  * The interfaces of the objects participationg the request live cycle and
    carrying the data, implement the ideas of the Standard PHP Library (SPL).
  * The controller is extensible by other extensions by registration of
    additional actions.
  * Assisting objects are provided i.e. to access the configuration and the
    parameters.
  * A link object is provided to build valid typolinks with a simple API.

    * Init/fill the parameters directly in the parameters object, not in
  the controller.
    * Same for configuration.
    * How to access configuration from $TSFE?
    * How to access configuration from $this-cObj?
    * Extending the image object.
		* Providing a Resultbrowser
