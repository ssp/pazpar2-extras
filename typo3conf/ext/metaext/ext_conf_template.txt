# cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Extend Constant Editor:If enabled, the 'class.t3lib_tsparser_ext' will be xclassed to add some more subcategories which helps to arrange the editable options. no 'class.t3lib_tsparser_ext' function will actually be overwritten so this should be uncritical for the future. If you don't install this patch, all entries with extended subcategories will be grouped under the default subcategory 'Others', so this is only a cosmetic though recommended patch.

# cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Patch 6637:If enabled, the 'class.tslib_menu' will be xclassed to apply patch6637 (see: http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6637), which will give you a 'reverseOrder' for hmenu special = rootline. without applying this patch (or patching the core file itself) the reverse rootline titletag feature won't work. NOTE: This patch becomes obsolete for Typo3 >= 4.3 as this functionality will be incorporated with this version.

# cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=disableNoCacheParameter:This turns off the ability to disable caching on several locations. On the page cahing policies, via setting config.no_cache = true or disabling caching inside extensions via set_no_cache(). All these settings will be ignored then.

# cat=basic/enable/a1; type=boolean; label=Hide Untranslated Pages: If this setting is checked, all pages with no translation won't show up in the menu if the language setting is not L=0 (which would be the default language). Hiding untranslated pages is neccessary if you use the config option 'sys_language_mode = strict' which would result in a 404 if a page isn't translated yet. and 'sys_language_mode = fallback' is no good idea at all, because of the double content which would be created if the language overlay sends out the untranslated content when calling the page in a language which is not the default (L=0). Changing this setting eventually changes the behaviour the a setting under Web->Page->Page properties->Localization settings-> from 'Hide page if no translation for current language exists' to 'Show page even if no translation exists'. That in mind you should check this setting on pages where you manually changed them earlier, because they will behave exactly oposite.

This website is brought to you by TYPO3 ...' comment in the head section of your created pagecontent. even though it is not needed for maintaining the copyright laws, it is highly encouradged and a friendly turn to place this notice within the header. both, the sorting header tags and the remove ALL html comments options do remove these lines. if you leave this option enabled, the comment will get reinjected in any case.

# cat=basic/chtml; type=boolean; label=remove comment tags within cdata:If some extension produces additional comment tags inside cdata markings like so: '/*<![CDATA[*/ <!--  .... // --> /*]]>*/' the '<!--' and '// -->' part will get removed if this option is selected. The point is if they remain within style tags, the gecko engine is moaning about invalid selectors which is actually not an error but an avoidable warning. the flipside would be that if you turn this feature on, really very old browser might display the content of inline script and style tags, because they're not able to interprete these. if you have concerns about this or you don't encounter these sort of cdata + htmlcomment in your code, you might simply leave this feature unselected. this feature is only active if the 'remove all html comments' feature is also activated, anyway.
